#  YummyKart – Food Ordering Website

YummyKart is a **frontend-only food ordering web application** built using **React.js, HTML, and CSS**, inspired by platforms like **Zomato** and **Swiggy**. It simulates a real food-ordering experience with features such as item categories, cart management, modals, animations, and a success confirmation flow – all without a backend.
